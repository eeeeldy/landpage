Hi its Eldrian and i create this minimalist sample of portfolio. and maybe you just wonder why there is empty in section of WORK, in that container, You and I can create our design on how do we put our design and animation to show our works. hehehe sorry to give you a lack of effort i guess.
but yeah thats is my design, i always prefer minimal. and the assignment on odin bootcamp is perfect beacause it contains all i want when i create a minimalist deisgn on web. 
so i hope yall like it, i may update this on the future to show to my clients, give it some designs and animation to be more presentable. 
thankyou very much. love y'all
